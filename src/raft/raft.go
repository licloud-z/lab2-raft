// RaftInterface -- this is the "service interface" that is implemented by each Raft peer using the
// remote library from Lab 1.  it supports five remote methods that you must define and implement.
// these methods are described as follows:
//
// 1) RequestVote -- this is one of the remote calls defined in the Raft paper, and it should be
//    supported as such.  you will need to include whatever argument types are needed per the Raft
//    algorithm, and you can package the return values however you like, as long as the last return
//    type is `remote.RemoteObjectError`, since that is required for the remote library use.
//
// 2) AppendEntries -- this is one of the remote calls defined in the Raft paper, and it should be
//    supported as such and defined in a similar manner to RequestVote above.
//
// 3) GetCommittedCmd -- this is a remote call that is used by the Controller in the test code. it
//    allows the Controller to check the value of a commmitted log entry at a given index. the 
//    type of the function is given below, and it must be implemented as given, otherwise the test
//    code will not function correctly.  more detail about this method is available later in this
//    starter code file.
//
// 4) GetStatus -- this is a remote call that is used by the Controller to collect status information
//    about the Raft peer.  the struct type that it returns is defined above, and it must be implemented
//    as given, or the Controller and test code will not function correctly.  more detail below.
//
// 5) NewCommand -- this is a remote call that is used by the Controller to emulate submission of 
//    a new command value by a Raft client.  upon receipt, it will initiate processing of the command
//    and reply back to the Controller with a StatusReport struct as defined above. it must be
//    implemented as given, or the test code will not function correctly.  more detail below

// you will need to define a struct that contains the parameters/variables that define and
// explain the current status of each Raft peer.  it doesn't matter what you call this struct,
// and the test code doesn't really care what state it contains, so this part is up to you.
// TODO: define a struct to maintain the local state of a single Raft peer
struct RaftPeer {
    


// `NewRaftPeer` -- this method should create an instance of the above struct and return a pointer
// to it back to the Controller, which calls this method.  this allows the Controller to create, 
// interact with, and control the configuration as needed.  this method takes three parameters:
// -- port: this is the service port number where this Raft peer will listen for incoming messages
// -- id: this is the ID (or index) of this Raft peer in the peer group, ranging from 0 to num-1
// -- num: this is the number of Raft peers in the peer group (num > id)
func NewRaftPeer(port int, id int, num int) *struct{} {  // TODO: <---- change the return type
// TODO: create a new raft peer and return a pointer to it

// when a new raft peer is created, its initial state should be populated into the corresponding
// struct entries, and its `remote.Service` and `remote.StubFactory` components should be created,
// but the Service should not be started (the Controller will do that when ready).
// 
// the `remote.Service` should be bound to port number `port`, as given in the input argument.
// each `remote.StubFactory` will be used to interact with a different Raft peer, and different
// port numbers are used for each Raft peer.  the Controller assigns these port numbers sequentially
// starting from peer with `id = 0` and ending with `id = num-1`, so any peer who knows its own
// `id`, `port`, and `num` can determine the port number used by any other peer.

    return nil
}

// `Activate` -- this method operates on your Raft peer struct and initiates functionality
// to allow the Raft peer to interact with others.  before the peer is activated, it can 
// have internal algorithm state, but it cannot make remote calls using its stubs or receive
// remote calls using its underlying remote.Service interface.  in essence, when not activated, 
// the Raft peer is "sleeping" from the perspective of any other Raft peer.
//
// this method is used exclusively by the Controller whenever it needs to "wake up" the Raft
// peer and allow it to start interacting with other Raft peers.  this is used to emulate
// connecting a new peer to the network or recovery of a previously failed peer.
//
// when this method is called, the Raft peer should do whatever is necessary to enable its 
// remote.Service interface to support remote calls from other Raft peers as soon as the method 
// returns (i.e., if it takes time for the remote.Service to start, this method should not 
// return until that happens).  the method should not otherwise block the Controller, so it may 
// be useful to spawn go routines from this method to handle the on-going operation of the Raft
// peer until the remote.Service stops.
//
// given an instance `rf` of your Raft peer struct, the Controller will call this method
// as `rf.Activate()`, so you should define this method accordingly. NOTE: this is _not_
// a remote call using the `remote.Service` interface of the Raft peer.  it uses direct
// method calls from the Controller, and is used purely for the purposes of the test code.
// you should not be using this method for any messaging between Raft peers.
//
// TODO: implement the `Activate` method

// `Deactivate` -- this method performs the "inverse" operation to `Activate`, namely to emulate
// disconnection / failure of the Raft peer.  when called, the Raft peer should effectively "go
// to sleep", meaning it should stop its underlying remote.Service interface, including shutting
// down the listening socket, causing any further remote calls to this Raft peer to fail due to 
// connection error.  when deactivated, a Raft peer should not make or receive any remote calls,
// and any execution of the Raft protocol should effectively pause.  however, local state should
// be maintained, meaning if a Raft node was the LEADER when it was deactivated, it should still
// believe it is the leader when it reactivates.
//
// given an instance `rf` of your Raft peer struct, the Controller will call this method
// as `rf.Deactivate()`, so you should define this method accordingly. Similar notes / details
// apply here as with `Activate`
// 
// TODO: implement the `Deactivate` method



// TODO: implement remote method calls from other Raft peers:
//
// RequestVote -- as described in the Raft paper, called by other Raft peers
//
// AppendEntries -- as described in the Raft paper, called by other Raft peers
//
// GetCommittedCmd -- called (only) by the Controller.  this method provides an input argument
// `index`.  if the Raft peer has a log entry at the given `index`, and that log entry has been
// committed (per the Raft algorithm), then the command stored in the log entry should be returned
// to the Controller.  otherwise, the Raft peer should return the value 0, which is not a valid
// command number and indicates that no committed log entry exists at that index
//
// GetStatus -- called (only) by the Controller.  this method takes no arguments and is essentially
// a "getter" for the state of the Raft peer, including the Raft peer's current term, current last
// log index, role in the Raft algorithm, and total number of remote calls handled since starting.
// the method returns a `StatusReport` struct as defined at the top of this file.
//
// NewCommand -- called (only) by the Controller.  this method emulates submission of a new command
// by a Raft client to this Raft peer, which should be handled and processed according to the rules
// of the Raft algorithm.  once handled, the Raft peer should return a `StatusReport` struct with
// the updated status after the new command was handled.


// general notes:
// 
// - you are welcome to use additional helper functions to handle aspects of the Raft algorithm logic
//   within the scope of a single Raft peer.  you should not need to create any additional remote
//   calls between Raft peers or the Controller.  if there is a desire to create additional remote
//   calls, please talk with the course staff before doing so.
//
// - please make sure to read the Raft paper (https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) before attempting
//   any coding for this lab.  you will most likely need to refer to it many times during your
//   implementation and testing tasks, so please consult the paper for algorithm details.
//
// - each Raft peer will accept a lot of remote calls from other Raft peers and the Controller,
//   so use of locks / mutexes is essential.  you are expected to use locks correctly in order to
//   prevent race conditions in your implementation.  the Makefile supports testing both without
//   and with go's race detector, and the final auto-grader will enable the race detector, which will
//   cause tests to fail if any race conditions are encountered.
